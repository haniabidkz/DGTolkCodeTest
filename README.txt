===== Thoughts About the Code =====

-Overall the code structure seems reasonable as it is using repository pattern for code seperation which is recommended approach.

-Code Duplication: In the code i found code duplication in some places, for example, the acceptJob and acceptJobWithId methods had similar logic so i combine them into one method.

-Database Operations: I found that that some direct database operations in the controller and repository could be moved to models to better match MVC architecture. If models were present in the codebase i could have used scopes for some database operations.

-Length of Methods: Some methods are very long and seem to be doing more than one thing. I tried to break them into smaller and focused methods for code improved readability.

-Variable Names: I found that variable names were just okay and can be more descriptive enough
